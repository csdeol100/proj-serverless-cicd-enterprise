## Serverless CI/CD for the enterprise on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start builds a serverless CI/CD environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, to provide an enterprise-ready, dynamic deployment pipeline for your serverless applications.

It is for users who want to get started in developing serverless applications on AWS, need an enterprise-ready deployment pipeline, and want to reduce the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building, managing, and securing their own, custom-built deployment pipeline. 

After you prepare separate AWS accounts for development, production, and shared services, you can use the AWS CloudFormation templates provided by the Quick Start to set up the CI/CD environment in about 20 minutes.
You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
The Quick Start includes a minimal sample serverless application that uses the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM).
